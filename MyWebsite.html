                    bacheleors in Mechnaical Engineering. Although I am trying to become an Engineer, I am willing to
                    learn all types of skills to help me become more skillful. I am currently learning coding languages 
                    during my free time as I find coding fun and closely related to engineering. In addition, one day I want to
                    recreate and improve a game I played duuring my Elementary school days, Graal Online ERA. While my
                    main goal is to be a successful engineer that can improve living standards and solve global issues
                    with innovations.

                    The ideal engineering industries for me are automative and robotics. While for programming, I am
                    seeking to improve my coding fundementals as I only have basic knowledge of the coding languages I know. However,
                    I am also willing to work in other industries as long as I can gain new skills or improve on my current skills.

                    to create a functional game at the time. The first game I created worked but was filled with problems which was not what I desired.
                    The second game I created function way smoother and through designing game, for my own interest, I learned the basic for 2D game creation 
                    and how to code in C#.</P> </div>

                    a discord bot that serves little to no purpose. </P></div>
                    <div class="starthidden marg" id="SolidWorks"> <p> I learned SolidWorks during my time a City College of New York. In the class I took we learnt how

                        shape to a 3D shapes or to make curvatures, wires, intrusions, shells, planes, mirroring, pattern, screws, and many more. Ultimately in the class I was able to design a hand mixer.

                    <div class="starthidden marg" id="Workshop Machinary"> I learned how to use workshop michanary at my time at Rensselear Polytechnical Insitute. During the class,
                        we had to create a cannon or a train. My partner and I, we did work in pairs, decided to both make a cannon. We were taught the basic of the Lathe, Vertical Mill,
                        Drill press, Horizontal Mill, Band saw, polisher. In addition, we were taught about metal welding, non-metal welding, and laser cutting. But most importantly
                        how to safely used these equipments. Ultimately to finish the project, my partner and I needed to learn the tool together through reading the lab manual.

                        as I developed the game in Unity. The game has basic two movement and interactions inspired by Among Us. However, unlike the game Among Us,
                        the multiplayer feature had a lot of glitches like one player movement cause another player screen to shake. Thus, this was a failure but I learnt
                        a lot about game creation from this.

                            The purpose of the game is to solve puzzles kill monsters and beat the final boss before you die a total of ten times. The game is actually quite hard 
                            so you should give it a try. When creating this single player game I gained further knowledge on game creation with new features like inventory, NPC movements,
                            and dropping items. Thus, the game is not perfect but included everythign I learned up to this point.

                                four other SYEP workers and we decided to communicate through discord. I decided to create a bot that send annoucment during certain time of the day like when
                                it's lunch break, when break is over, when it's time to leave, and when to start working. In addition, the bot also has a reaction tracker which 
                                was used for determining who was in the building or who went out or stayed in for lunch.

                            <p id="projdesc"> The cannon was made in my Engineering Processes class which we learned about workshop machinary. For the class we worked in pairs to understand
                                how to complete each step on the manual as percise as possible. My partner and I worked really well and learnt off of each others mistake when we realize something
                                was odd. Machines and tools that we learned how to safely used consist of the Lathe, Vertical Mill, Horizontal Mill, Band Saw, Polisher, Caliber, Micrometer, Drill Press. For each of the machinaries,
                                we learnt basic skills like facing something off, knurling, creating ridges, angle cutting, and others. The barrel of the cannon, the pin, and the wheels are 
                                made using the Lathe, while the carriage is made using the vertical mill, horizontal mill, drill press, and band saw. Ultimately, cannon building was an enjoyable experience
                                as it was really hands on and we collaborated really well as a pair.

                                this simple website took a long time. In this website, I tried to include everything I have learned to the best of my ability. Also for the website, I tried
                                my best to make it scaleable for different devices other than the computer. If you have any suggestion to help me improve my website you can email me using the email
